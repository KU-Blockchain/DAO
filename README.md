# KUBI DAO and Dework

## Mission
The KUBI DAO puts our Members at the Center of our Institute with Direct Democracy Voting on imporant issues through the KUBI1 token and rewards participation with KUBIX

## Goals
- Developing smart contracts for the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)
- Integrating our DAO with the KUBI website eventually 
- Providing a platform for students to learn about and experiment with blockchain technology

## Getting Started

To get started with the KUBI project, you'll need to have a basic understanding of blockchain technology and smart contracts. If you're new to these concepts, we recommend starting with the following resources:

- [Intro to Blockchain](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-technology-introduction/)
- [Introduction to Smart Contracts](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/smart-contracts/)

To create a DAO, you will need to have a basic understanding of smart contract programming. There are many resources available online that can help you learn how to code a DAO, including the following:

- [Learn Solidity and Smart Contracts: Learnweb3](https://learnweb3.io) 
- [Creating a DAO in Solidity](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-code-an-on-chain-dao-e525e13a57be)

It's also a good idea to familiarize yourself with the tools and frameworks that are commonly used for developing smart contracts and DAOs, such as [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/) and [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org/).


Once you have a basic understanding, you can begin exploring the code in this repository and getting involved in our development efforts.
